"""
Some observations that may be useful to experimenting with different loss
functions.

Tversky and Focal-Tversky loss benefit from very low learning rates, of the
order 5e-5 to 1e-4. They would not see much improvement in my kernels until
around 7-10 epochs, upon which performance would improve significantly.

In general, if a loss function does not appear to be working well (or at
all), experiment with modifying the learning rate before moving on to other
options.

You can easily create your own loss functions by combining any of the above
with Binary Cross-Entropy or any combination of other losses. Bear in mind
that loss is calculated for every batch, so more complex losses will increase
runtime.

Care must be taken when writing loss functions for PyTorch. If you call a
function to modify the inputs that doesn't entirely use PyTorch's numerical
methods, the tensor will 'detach' from the graph that maps it back
through the neural network for the purposes of backpropagation, making the
loss function unusable.

    Tversky Loss This loss was introduced in "Tversky loss function for image
    segmentationusing 3D fully convolutional deep networks", retrievable
    here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.05721. It was designed to optimise
    segmentation on imbalanced medical datasets by utilising constants that
    can adjust how harshly different types of error are penalised in the loss
    function. From the paper:

    ... in the case of α=β=0.5 the Tversky index simplifies to be the same as
    the Dice coefficient, which is also equal to the F1 score. With α=β=1,
    Equation 2 produces Tanimoto coefficient, and setting α+β=1 produces the
    set of Fβ scores. Larger βs weigh recall higher than precision (by placing
    more emphasis on false negatives).

    To summarise, this loss function is weighted by the constants 'alpha' and
    'beta' that penalise false positives and false negatives respectively to a
    higher degree in the loss function as their value is increased. The beta
    constant in particular has applications in situations where models can
    obtain misleadingly positive performance via highly conservative
    prediction. You may want to experiment with different values to find the
    optimum. With alpha==beta==0.5, this loss becomes equivalent to Dice Loss.
